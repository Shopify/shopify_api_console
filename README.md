Starting with v2.0, the gem has been renamed to `shopify_api_console`. We recommend switching to shopify_api_console v2.0+ as soon as possible.

1.x versions will continue to exist on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/shopify_cli) and in the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_cli/releases). If you _must_ use one of these releases, make sure to specify a version:

```
